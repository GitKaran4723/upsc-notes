    "explanation": "Statement I is correct: Subtropical and temperate regions, especially arid and semi-arid zones like the Sahara and Middle East, have more dust in the atmosphere due to high wind activity and dry conditions.\n\nStatement II is incorrect: These regions **do not** have less dry winds—in fact, they often experience **strong dry winds** (e.g., trade winds, westerlies, or regional winds like the Harmattan and Santa Ana), which contribute to increased dust levels.\n\nHence, while Statement I is correct, Statement II is not.

Hence, in January, **air over oceans is warmer** than that over land.\n\nStatement II explains the reason for the isotherm bending described in Statement I.
