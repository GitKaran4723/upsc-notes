Income from allied activities like poultry farming or wool rearing **is not treated as agricultural income** and may be **taxable**, even if it is conducted in rural areas.\n\nStatement II is **correct**: According to Section 2(14)(iii) of the Income-tax Act, 1961, **rural agricultural land in India is not treated as a 'capital asset'**, and thus any gains from its sale are **not subject to capital gains tax**.\n\nTherefore, only Statement II is correct."

MSP is a strategic grouping of countries like the US, Japan, Australia, etc., aiming to ensure stable and secure supply chains for critical minerals.\n\nStatement II is incorrect: While India has identified 30 critical minerals, it is **not resource-rich in all of them**. For example, India depends on imports for minerals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel, which are crucial for energy transition and electronics.\n\nStatement III is correct: In 2023, the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 was **amended** to empower the Central Government to **exclusively auction mining leases and composite licenses** for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, etc.\n\nHence, only Statements I and III are correct."

    "explanation": "Statement I is correct: Bondholders are generally at a lower risk compared to stockholders because they have fixed interest payments and priority in repayment during liquidation.\n\nStatement II is correct: Bondholders are creditors (lenders) to the company, while stockholders are part-owners of the company. This distinction is fundamental to corporate finance.\n\nStatement III is correct: In case of bankruptcy or liquidation, companies are legally obligated to repay bondholders before any payment is made to stockholders. This repayment hierarchy is why bondholders face lower risk.\n\nSince Statements II and III both accurately explain why Statement I is true, option (a) is correct."
