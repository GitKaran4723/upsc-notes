        "statements": [
          "The isotherms deviate to the north over the ocean and to the south over the continent.",
          "The presence of cold ocean currents, Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift make the North Atlantic Ocean colder and the isotherms bend towards the north."
        ],
        "options": [
          "1 only",
          "2 only",
          "Both 1 and 2",
          "Neither 1 nor 2"
        ],
        "correct_option": "1 only",
        "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: In January, isotherms tend to bend equatorward (south) over continents and poleward (north) over oceans due to differences in heat capacity.\n\nStatement 2 is incorrect: Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift are warm ocean currents, not cold ones. They make the North Atlantic Ocean warmer, not colder, and cause isotherms to bend poleward. Hence, statement 2 is factually incorrect. ![Read More](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Isotherm)"
