## 🧬 **Cell Biology & Genetics** – Micro Syllabus Listing with Brief Intros

---

### 🔹 **1. Cell Structure, Function and Cell Cycle**
- **Cell Structure**: Components like nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplast, ER, ribosomes
- **Function**: Organelle-specific roles in growth, respiration, protein synthesis
- **Cell Cycle**: Phases – G₁, S, G₂, M; significance of mitosis and meiosis

---

### 🔹 **2. Synthesis, Structure, and Function of Genetic Material**
- **DNA and RNA**: Double helix, types (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA)
- **Replication, Transcription, Translation**
- Central dogma of molecular biology

---

### 🔹 **3. Laws of Heredity**
- **Mendel's Laws**: Dominance, Segregation, Independent Assortment
- **Monohybrid and Dihybrid crosses**
- Use in trait inheritance prediction

---

### 🔹 **4. Chromosome Structure and Aberrations**
- **Structure**: Chromatid, centromere, telomere
- **Aberrations**:
  - **Structural**: deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations
  - **Numerical**: aneuploidy, polyploidy

---

### 🔹 **5. Linkage, Crossing Over and Their Role in Recombination**
- **Linkage**: genes on same chromosome inherited together
- **Crossing Over**: exchange of segments during meiosis
- **Genetic recombination** and mapping

---

### 🔹 **6. Polyploidy, Euploids and Aneuploidy**
- **Polyploidy**: more than two sets of chromosomes (e.g., triploid, tetraploid)
- **Euploids**: complete chromosome sets
- **Aneuploidy**: gain/loss of one or few chromosomes (e.g., trisomy)

---

### 🔹 **7. Mutations and Their Role in Crop Improvement**
- **Gene and chromosomal mutations**
- **Mutagens**: physical (radiation), chemical (EMS)
- Applications in **mutation breeding**

---

### 🔹 **8. Heritability, Sterility, and Incompatibility**
- **Heritability**: proportion of trait variance due to genetics
- **Sterility**: male/female sterility (e.g., CMS in hybrids)
- **Incompatibility**: barriers to fertilization (self vs cross)

---

### 🔹 **9. Classification and Application in Crop Improvement**
- **Qualitative vs Quantitative characters**
- **Genetic variance**, **GCV**, **PCV**
- Traits targeted in breeding

---

### 🔹 **10. Cytoplasmic Inheritance**
- Inheritance via organelles like **mitochondria**, **chloroplasts**
- Maternal inheritance patterns
- Example: leaf color in maize, male sterility

---

### 🔹 **11. Sex-Linked, Sex-Influenced and Sex-Limited Characters**
- **Sex-linked**: genes on sex chromosomes (e.g., color blindness)
- **Sex-influenced**: expressed differently in sexes (e.g., baldness)
- **Sex-limited**: traits only in one sex (e.g., milk production in females)
