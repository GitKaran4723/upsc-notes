## ðŸŒ¾ **Seed Technology & IPR** â€“ Micro Syllabus Listing with Brief Intros

---

### ðŸ”¹ **1. Seed Production and Processing Technologies**
- **Seed production**: Scientific methods to maintain genetic purity and quality during multiplication.
- **Nucleus seed**, **Breeder seed**, **Foundation seed**, **Certified seed**: different stages of seed multiplication.
- **Processing**: Involves drying, cleaning, grading, treating, and packaging of seeds to ensure viability and uniformity.

### ðŸ”¹ **2. Seed Certification, Testing, and Storage**
- **Seed certification**: Official process ensuring genetic and physical purity.
  - Agencies: State Seed Certification Agencies (SSCA).
  - **Field inspections**, **seed sampling**, and **labeling**.
- **Seed testing**: Viability, germination %, moisture content, seed health.
- **Storage**: Maintaining seed longevity with proper temperature and humidity control.
  - **Orthodox vs recalcitrant seeds**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **3. DNA Fingerprinting and Seed Registration**
- **DNA fingerprinting**: Technique to identify seed varieties using molecular markers (e.g., SSRs).
- Ensures **varietal purity** and protection against fraud.
- **Seed registration**: Required for commercialization under the **Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmersâ€™ Rights Act (PPV&FR), 2001**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **4. Role of Public and Private Sectors in Seed Production and Marketing**

### ðŸ”¹ **5. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in Agriculture**
- **IPR**: Legal rights that protect innovations and creations in seed technology and breeding.
- Types relevant to agriculture:
  - **Patents**
  - **Plant Breederâ€™s Rights (PBR)**
  - **Trademarks**
  - **Geographical Indications (GI)**
- **Plant Variety Protection (PVP)** laws: Protect breeder innovations.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **6. WTO Issues and Impact on Indian Agriculture**
- **TRIPS Agreement**: Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights under WTO.
- Compels countries to offer **plant variety protection**, either through patents or sui generis systems.
- India adopted the **PPV&FR Act, 2001** instead of UPOV.
- **Farmersâ€™ rights vs breedersâ€™ rights**: Ensuring seed sovereignty.
