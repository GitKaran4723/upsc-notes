## ðŸŒ± **Plant Breeding & Biotechnology** â€“ Micro Syllabus Listing with Brief Intros

---

### ðŸ”¹ **1. History of Plant Breeding**
- **Origins**: Traditional methods (selection, hybridization) and their evolution.
- Key milestones: **Mendelâ€™s work**, **Green Revolution**.
- Early geneticists and contributions in plant breeding.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **2. Modes of Reproduction, Selfing, and Crossing Techniques**
- **Asexual reproduction**: Cloning, vegetative propagation.
- **Sexual reproduction**: Self-pollination vs cross-pollination.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Selfing**: Generation of pure lines (e.g., inbreeding).
  - **Crossing**: Hybridization (e.g., interspecific, intergeneric crosses).

---

### ðŸ”¹ **3. Origin, Evolution, and Domestication of Crop Plants**
- **Centers of origin**: Vavilovâ€™s centers (e.g., Mesopotamia for wheat).
- **Crop domestication**: Process and genetic changes from wild ancestors to cultivated varieties.
- **Gene pool**: Wild relatives as genetic resources for breeding.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **4. Application of Principles of Plant Breeding**
- **Selection methods**:
  - **Mass selection**: Selection of superior individuals from population.
  - **Pedigree method**: Selection based on family history.
  - **Bulk method**: Selection from large populations.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **5. Molecular Markers and Their Application in Plant Improvement**
- **Molecular markers**: Techniques like **RFLP**, **SSR**, **SNP**.
- **Marker-assisted selection (MAS)**: Speeding up breeding processes for traits like disease resistance.
- Use of **genomic selection** in crop improvement.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **6. Pure-Line Selection, Pedigree, Mass and Recurrent Selections**
- **Pure-line selection**: Maintaining uniformity in progeny.
- **Pedigree selection**: Tracking family tree for desirable traits.
- **Mass selection**: Bulk selection for phenotypic traits.
- **Recurrent selection**: Improving population by selecting superior individuals.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **7. Heterosis and Its Exploitation**
- **Heterosis (hybrid vigor)**: Increased vigor, yield, or other traits in hybrid offspring.
- **F1 hybrids**: Superior traits observed in first-generation hybrids.
- Examples: hybrid maize, hybrid rice.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **8. Somatic Hybridization**
- **Somatic fusion**: Fusion of protoplasts from different species for creating hybrid plants.
- Role of **somatic hybrids** in overcoming sexual incompatibility.
- **Cybrid**: Cytoplasmic hybrid.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **9. Breeding for Disease and Pest Resistance**
- **Resistance breeding**: Development of varieties resistant to diseases (e.g., rust in wheat).
- **Gene pyramiding**: Combining multiple genes for resistance.
- **Marker-assisted breeding** for pest resistance (e.g., Bt cotton).

---

### ðŸ”¹ **10. Role of Interspecific and Intergeneric Hybridization**
- **Interspecific hybridization**: Crosses between different species within the same genus (e.g., wheat Ã— rye).
- **Intergeneric hybridization**: Crosses between species from different genera (e.g., Triticale).
- **Significance**: Hybrid vigor, novel traits.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **11. Role of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology in Crop Improvement**
- **Genetic engineering**: Insertion of desired genes into crop genomes (e.g., Bt crops, Golden Rice).
- **Transgenic plants**: Creation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
- **Biotechnology applications**: CRISPR-Cas9 for gene editing, RNA interference for trait silencing.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **12. Genetically Modified (GM) Crop Plants**
- **GMOs**: Crops with modified DNA for improved yield, pest resistance, tolerance to stress.
- Examples: **Bt cotton**, **Bt brinjal**, **Golden Rice**.
- **Regulations and concerns**: Environmental, health, and ethical implications.
