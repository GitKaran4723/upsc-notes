## 🛡️ **Plant Protection & Food Security** – Micro Syllabus Listing with Brief Intros

---

### 🐛 **Part A: Plant Protection**

---

### 🔹 1. **Diagnosis of Pests and Diseases of Field, Vegetable, Orchard, and Plantation Crops**
- **Identification techniques**: visual symptoms, microscopic signs.
- Understanding **insect pests**, **fungal**, **bacterial**, and **viral** diseases.
- Focus on **crop-specific problems**: e.g., stem borer in rice, blight in wheat.

---

### 🔹 2. **Classification of Pests and Diseases**
- Based on:
  - **Host crops** (e.g., rice pests, cotton diseases)
  - **Nature of damage** (defoliators, sap-suckers, borers)
  - **Pathogen type** (fungal, bacterial, viral, nematodal)

---

### 🔹 3. **Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPM & IDM)**
- **IPM**: use of multiple pest control strategies in a sustainable way.
  - **Cultural**, **biological**, **mechanical**, **chemical** methods.
- **IDM**: similar approach for disease control.
- Reduces pesticide use, promotes ecological balance.

---

### 🔹 4. **Storage Pests and Their Management**
- Pests: **grain weevil**, **khapra beetle**, **rice moth**.
- Management:
  - **Drying**, **fumigation**, **hermetic storage**, **integrated storage management**.

---

### 🔹 5. **Biological Control of Pests and Diseases**
- Use of **natural enemies**:
  - **Parasitoids** (e.g., Trichogramma)
  - **Predators** (e.g., ladybird beetles)
  - **Pathogens** (e.g., Bacillus thuringiensis)
- Eco-friendly alternative to chemicals.

---

### 🔹 6. **Epidemiology and Forecasting of Major Crop Pests and Diseases**
- Study of **disease cycles**, **weather parameters**, and **outbreak patterns**.
- Use of **forecast models** for early warning and management.
- Tools: **mobile apps**, **GIS**, **remote sensing**.

---

### 🔹 7. **Plant Quarantine Measures**
- Legal and scientific measures to **prevent entry and spread of pests/diseases**.
- Implementation at ports/entry points.
- **Quarantine pests**: pests not present in India but could pose threat.

---

### 🔹 8. **Pesticides – Formulation and Mode of Action**
- Types: **insecticides**, **fungicides**, **herbicides**, **nematicides**.
- **Formulations**: WP, EC, SC, GR, etc.
- Mode of action: contact, systemic, stomach poisons, respiratory poisons.

---

### 🍚 **Part B: Food Production & Nutrition Management**

---

### 🔹 1. **Food Production and Consumption Trends in India**
- Rising **production** of cereals, pulses, horticulture.
- Shifts in **diet patterns**, urbanization impact.

---

### 🔹 2. **Food Security and Growing Population – Vision 2020**
- Concept of **food security**: availability, accessibility, affordability, and absorption.
- **India’s efforts**: NFSA (National Food Security Act), buffer stock.

---

### 🔹 3. **Reasons for Grain Surplus**
- Green Revolution
- **MSP and procurement policies**
- Issues: **storage losses**, **distribution inefficiencies**

---

### 🔹 4. **National and International Food Policies**
- India: **PDS**, **TPDS**, **Mid-day Meal**
- Global: **FAO**, **WFP**, **SDG-2 (Zero Hunger)**

---

### 🔹 5. **Production, Procurement, and Distribution Constraints**
- Production: climatic shocks, input issues
- Procurement: MSP coverage limitations
- Distribution: logistics, leakage, targeting inefficiency

---

### 🔹 6. **Availability of Food Grains & Per Capita Expenditure**
- **Food grain buffer stocks**
- **Expenditure trends** among urban/rural populations

---

### 🔹 7. **Trends in Poverty, PDS, and BPL Population**
- Impact of **subsidized food schemes** on poverty alleviation
- Shift from **universal to targeted PDS**
- Issues with **BPL identification**

---

### 🔹 8. **Processing Constraints**
- **Post-harvest losses**, poor infrastructure
- Low levels of **value addition**
- Lack of **cold chains** and agro-processing facilities

---

### 🔹 9. **Relation of Food Production to National Dietary Guidelines**
- Matching production with **nutritional needs**
- Encouraging **horticulture**, **millets**, and **pulses**

---

### 🔹 10. **Food-Based Dietary Approaches to Eliminate Hunger**
- **Diversified cropping**
- Nutrition-sensitive agriculture
- Promotion of **kitchen gardens**, **biofortified crops**

---

### 🔹 11. **Nutrient Deficiency – PEM, Micronutrients**
- **PEM (Protein-Energy Malnutrition)** in children and women
- **Micronutrient deficiencies**: Vitamin A, Iron, Iodine, Zinc
- Impact on **human resource development (HRD)**

---

### 🔹 12. **Food Grain Productivity and Food Security**
- Enhancing **yield per hectare** using better seeds, technology
- **Sustainable agriculture** for long-term food availability
