# Polity – UPSC Syllabus 2025–26

## Historical Evolution & Features

> The Indian Constitution evolved through a **series of historical developments**, including British-enacted acts like the Government of India Act, 1935, and the Indian freedom movement's demand for rights and democracy. Key milestones include the Nehru Report, **Karachi Resolution**, and the **Cabinet Mission Plan**. The Constituent Assembly, formed in 1946, drafted the Constitution, which came into force on 26 January 1950. Its salient features include a blend of rigidity and flexibility, a federal structure with unitary bias, parliamentary democracy, independent judiciary, fundamental rights, directive principles, secularism, and universal adult franchise, making it the lengthiest and one of the most **comprehensive constitutions globally**.
